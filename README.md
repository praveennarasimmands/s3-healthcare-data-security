# S3 Healthcare Data Security Project

## Domain: Healthcare

### Problem:
In the healthcare industry, protecting sensitive patient data is a critical concern. Healthcare organizations must comply with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations, which require strict access control over patient records, ensuring that only authorized healthcare professionals (e.g., doctors, administrators) can access sensitive data. Unauthorized access can lead to severe legal, financial, and reputational damage.

### Solution:
This project demonstrates how to use AWS S3 and IAM (Identity and Access Management) to create secure storage for healthcare data. By implementing restrictive bucket policies and role-based access, we can ensure that only authorized users (doctors, hospital admins) can access, read, and modify patient data. 

### Key Features:
- **S3 Bucket Security**: Creating an S3 bucket to securely store healthcare-related data.
- **IAM Policies**: Defining IAM policies to control access based on user roles and IP addresses.
- **Bucket Policy**: Implementing S3 bucket policies that restrict access to authorized users.

### Implementation:
1. **Create the S3 Bucket**: Store patient data in a secure S3 bucket.
2. **Define IAM Policies**: Create IAM policies that allow only healthcare professionals to access the bucket.
3. **Bucket Policy for Healthcare**: Restrict access to the S3 bucket based on IP addresses (hospital network) and user roles.

### Files:
- `healthcare-s3-policy.json`: IAM policy to allow only authorized healthcare users.
- `healthcare-bucket-policy.json`: S3 bucket policy to enforce access controls.

### Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Create an S3 bucket for healthcare data.
3. Apply IAM policies and bucket policy to restrict access to authorized users.
4. Follow the setup instructions in the repository files.
